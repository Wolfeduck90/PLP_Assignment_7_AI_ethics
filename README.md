# PLP_Assignment_7_AI_ethics


 **1. Short Answer Questions**

**Q1: Define *algorithmic bias* and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.**
**Answer:**
Algorithmic bias occurs when an AI system produces unfair, prejudiced, or discriminatory outcomes due to biased training data or design.
**Examples:**

1. A hiring algorithm favoring male applicants over female ones due to biased historical hiring data.
2. Facial recognition systems performing poorly on darker-skinned individuals because of underrepresentation in training datasets.



**Q2: Explain the difference between *transparency* and *explainability* in AI. Why are both important?**
**Answer:**
**Transparency** refers to how open an AI system is about its design, data, and decision-making processes.
**Explainability** means how well a system’s decisions can be understood by humans.
Both are important for building trust, ensuring accountability, and allowing users and regulators to understand and question AI behavior.

**Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?**
**Answer:**
GDPR requires AI systems to respect user privacy, gain clear consent for data use, and offer individuals the right to explanation and data deletion. It limits the use of automated decision-making and encourages ethical, transparent data handling practices.
